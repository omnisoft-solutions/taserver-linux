# Joining games

In order to join the OOTB games on community servers, you only need to 
[have Tribes Ascend installed](installing_tribes_and_prerequisites.md).

I have written three different sets of instructions showing you how to join.
You can select one of them below.

* [Short textual instructions](joining_games_short_textual.md)
* [Instructions with animated screenshots](joining_games_illustrated.md)
* [Completely automated setup](joining_games_automated.md)

If you need any help with this, join the [discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/8enekHQ) for this project.
