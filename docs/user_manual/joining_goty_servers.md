# About GOTY

GOTY stands for Game of the Year edition. It was a content update for Tribes Ascend that was 
released in February of 2013. It was later followed by the Out of the Blue (OOTB) update in
December of 2015.

The OOTB update drastically changed the way classes work, as well as the weapons and their stats.
Many people consider the GOTY release to be better than OOTB.

Using the taserver and TAMods projects we have been able to bring back GOTY functionality
without the need to revert your game to an older version. Since the v2.0.0 release of taserver
it is possible to have both GOTY and OOTB game servers listed in the same server list.

# Joining GOTY servers

Because of the drastic differences between GOTY and OOTB, TAMods is required on the client side
for playing in GOTY mode. The instructions below explain where to get it and how to use it.

1) If you don't have TribesLauncherSharp installed, download TribesLauncherSharp.zip from
   https://github.com/mcoot/TribesLauncherSharp/releases and extract it to a directory of your
   choosing.
   
2) Start TribesLauncherSharp.exe

3) In the window that opens make sure GamePath points to your TribesAscend.exe

4) Set "Injection" to automatic

5) Under "Log In Server" select "Community"
    
6) If the button in the bottom right says "Update" then click it to update.

7) Click the Launch button to start Tribes Ascend through the launcher.

8) Wait until you hear a sound that indicates that TAMods has been injected successfully.
   This should take about 20 seconds.

9) Log in as usual or choose a new username and password and log in with that

10) Once you are logged in, you may notice your username is prefixed by unvrf-.
    Settings such as loadouts will not be remembered across sessions unless you get verified.
    You can [read more about getting verified on this page](/docs/user_manual/getting_verified.md).

11) Press the "Switch to GOTY" menu option and you should see a message indicating you are 
    now in GOTY mode. The current mode is shown under "Play Now". If it still says OOTB mode,
    press "Switch to GOTY" again.
   
You should now be able to join GOTY game servers.
