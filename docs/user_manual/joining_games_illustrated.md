# Joining - Instructions with animated screenshots

This guide will show you step by step and with screenshots how to create a shortcut that you can 
use to launch Tribes Ascend and connect to the community hosted servers. You will only need to do
this once. The next time you want to play on community servers you can just double-click the already
created shortcut. 

* Find the shortcut that you use to start Tribes Ascend.
* Right-click on it and select `Properties`
* Now check if the dialog that opens looks more like the screenshot on the left or the one on the right
