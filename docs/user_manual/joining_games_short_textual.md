# Joining - Short instructions

To join OOTB games on the login server hosted by me (Griffon26), you don't need
to download anything. All you need to do is create a Windows shortcut to
`TribesAscend.exe` and add `-hostx=18.197.240.229` to the end of the target
field. If there are quotes around the executable then add the `-hostx` part
after the closing quotes. Also make sure there's a space before `-hostx`.

Start the game through the shortcut and log in **with any name and password**.
The login name you use will be the name that others see in-game. The servers
listed in the server browser will be servers hosted by fellow players.


If you want to join any of the GOTY servers in the list then you must be using TAMods.
