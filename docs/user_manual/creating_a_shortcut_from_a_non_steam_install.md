* If you still have the shortcut properties dialog open, then close it by pressing `Cancel` 

  ![non-steam shortcut](../images/tashortcut_nonsteam.png?raw=true)

* right-click on the shortcut and choose `Send to`, followed by `Desktop`

  ![shortcut send to desktop](../images/shortcut_send_to_desktop.gif?raw=true)

* find the newly created shortcut on your desktop, probably with a name similar to the original shortcut, right-click on it and select Properties
* in the Dialog that opens, go to the end of the Target field, and replace the numbers after `-hostx=` with `18.197.240.229`

  ![modify hostx](../images/modify_hostx.gif?raw=true)

* optionally choose a different name for this shortcut by clicking on the `General` tab and editing the name field at the top
* click `OK` to close the dialog
* you have now created a shortcut that you can use to start Tribes Ascend for playing on the community hosted servers
* after starting the game you can log in with any name and password, but be aware that 
  on the community servers **the login name you choose will also be your in-game name**.
  You can log in under a different name at any time though.
