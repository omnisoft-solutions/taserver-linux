# Joining - Automated setup

1) Download [`taserver_shortcut_creator.exe`](https://github.com/Griffon26/taserver/releases/download/v2.3.1/taserver_shortcut_creator.exe)
   and run it. This will create a "TribesAscend community" shortcut on your desktop that you can use to join the community servers.

2) Start the game through the shortcut and log in **with any name and password**.
   The login name you use will be the name that others see in-game. The servers
   listed in the server browser will be servers hosted by fellow players.
